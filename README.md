# README Generator
![Github license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)




## DESCRIPTION

- This project uses node js and inquirer to allow the user to generate a README file without having to do any of the formatting themselves. This takes most of the work out of creating a README. So instead of having to type everything out manually the user will simply answer some questions in the command line and the README will be created for them.

## INSTALLATION

- Make sure you have Node js, npm, and inquirer installed. you can install inquirer by running "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" in the command line. From there just open a terminal in the "Develop" folder. You can do this by right clicking the "Develop" folder and clicking "Open integrated terminal". Next just run "node .\index.js" and the application will ask questions about the project and use those answers to create the README.


## USAGE

- Run the application by typing node .\index.js in the terminal and answer the questions it asks you. This can be used with almost any project and will save a lot of time since you will not have to do any of the formatting that would noramlly be required when typing out a README by hand.
